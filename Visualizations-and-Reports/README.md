## Visualizations and Reports

This project demonstrates Power BI skills, including:

- **Loading and transforming data in Power Query** to prepare for analysis. Functions for cleaning, merging tables, calculated columns, and parameters for process automation were used.
- **Using measures, calculated columns, and DAX** for accurate calculations and data modeling. Aggregate metrics, period comparison calculations, and variable use in formulas to enhance performance were implemented.
- **Dashboard design setup**: Selection of colors, fonts, and information structuring for intuitive perception. UI/UX principles were applied, creating logical navigation, interactive panels, and emphasis on key indicators.
- **Using bookmarks and buttons** to create interactivity, such as chart and filter toggling. Dynamic page content changes were added without overloading the interface.
- **Performance optimization** through proper data model construction, minimizing unnecessary computations, and using efficient DAX formulas.
- **Adhering to best practices** to create user-friendly and stylish dashboards focused on usability.

## Dashboard Descriptions

### HR_Dashboard  
Dynamic elements were implemented in the dashboard, changing via buttons and bookmarks. For example, the filter panel switches to a navigation panel based on user selection, and charts alternate to display different metrics. Conditional formatting was added to visually highlight critical values. It can serve as a basis for a real HR report.
